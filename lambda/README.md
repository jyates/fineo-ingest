# Lamba Functions

Implementations of lambda functions for fineo.

## Building

Basic testing requirements:
 * Maven 3.X
 * Java 8

Additidonal deployment requirements
 * RVM - Ruby Version Manager

### Building deployable jar

The deployable jar uses a custom properties file to configure the various runtime properties of the Lambda functions. This properties file is generated by ```build.rb```, which then goes on to kick off a Maven build to generate the final jar. ```build.rb``` is used to easily override properties for the given runtime environment.

The first time attempting to build, you should execute:

```
 $ deploy/setup.sh
```

Which will initialize the ruby environment for you. From there, you can build immediately with:

```
 $ build.sh
```

See the help text of ```build.sh``` for how to use that script further.

### Testing
Basic tests are run with:

```
$ mvn test
```

AWS component using tests, including running a local DynamoDB instance, can be run (does not 
run basic tests) with:

```
$ mvn test -DawsLocalTests
```

Both sets of tests can be run together with:

```
$ mvn test -DallTests

## Packaging for deployment

A deployable package can be built with:

```
 $ ./build.rb <options>
```

It's a light wrapper around maven to add a properties file we can use to set connection information.
